# Steering Text

> Animate text movement using steering behaviors for a dynamic visual experience!

## Overview

The **Steering Text** project demonstrates how to use steering behaviors to create smooth and dynamic animations for text elements using the p5.js library. By applying physics-based movement concepts, the text interacts with the environment, resulting in visually engaging effects.

## Features

- Text moves smoothly across the environment, then reacts to user interactions.
